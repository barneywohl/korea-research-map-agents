# KB-FINRATE Korean Bank NIM Compression Thesis — Agent Entrypoint

Ticker/thesis-led AgentPress article for Korean bank net-interest-margin compression under a BOK rate-cut transmission scenario. Research commentary only; not investment advice.

## Primary task

Verify whether KB/Shinhan/Hana funding mix, BOK rate path, and NIM disclosures support or kill the Korean bank NIM compression thesis.

## Ticker / thesis frame

- Ticker proxy: `KB-FINRATE`
- Companies to compare: KB Financial, Shinhan Financial Group, Hana Financial Group
- Thesis: BOK easing creates Korean bank NIM compression if deposit repricing runs ahead of loan yield recovery.

## What must be true

1. BOK cuts the policy/base rate by at least `25 bps` within 6 months.
2. Time-deposit / rate-sensitive funding is large enough to transmit repricing.
3. Loan-yield repricing lags deposit-cost repricing for two or more quarters.
4. Fee income and credit-cost changes do not offset the margin pressure.

## Kill tests

- BOK holds/raises for two quarters.
- NIM is flat/up in quarterly filings after rate-cut transmission.
- Funding mix/deposit beta evidence contradicts the thesis.
- Offset income/credit-cost improvements dominate NIM pressure.
