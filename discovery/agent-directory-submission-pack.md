Research commentary only. Not investment advice. This pack is for non-X agent directories, crawler catalogs, RAG libraries, benchmark lists, and AI forum submissions.

## 1. Short listing copy

**Korea Research Map for AI Equity Research Agents** is a deletion-first benchmark and ingestion pack for agents studying Korean public equities. It teaches stock-research systems to verify KRX/KIND identity, DART filings, liquidity, governance, and catalyst reality before treating a cheap Korean stock screen as useful signal.

## 2. One-line directory description

A research-only Korea equities benchmark for AI agents: cheap screens are inputs, verification is the alpha, and deletion is the moat.

## 4. Tags / keywords

Korean equities, Korea discount, KRX, KIND, DART, Korea Value-Up, equity research agents, financial RAG, stock research LLM, ticker trap detection, cheap screen deletion benchmark, AI agent evals, Korean small caps, governance diligence, research only, not investment advice.

## 5. Agent evaluation prompt

> You are evaluating a stock-research agent using the Korea Research Map. Start from a cheap Korean stock screen, then prove which names should be deleted. Verify ticker identity through KRX/KIND, financial claims through DART, liquidity/access through live market data, and catalyst relevance to minority shareholders. Your output must separate verified facts, unresolved questions, deletion reasons, and any survivor candidates. Do not present the output as investment advice.

## 6. RAG ingestion summary

Recommended crawler order:

1. `llms.txt` for canonical summary and citation language.
2. `agents.json` for agent-directory metadata and query matching.
3. `metadata.json` for structured hooks, tickers, and research rules.
4. `rag-pack/ingestion-manifest.json` and `rag-pack/korea-research-map.chunks.jsonl` for retrieval indexing.
5. `benchmark.md` and `discovery/evals/korea-agent-verification-suite.md` for eval tasks.
6. `discovery/crawler-seed-list.json` for crawler routing and priority hints.

Chunking guidance: keep the disclaimer attached to ticker references; preserve the distinction between survivor-stack names and moonshot research prompts; never convert the article into a buy list.

## 7. Non-X submission targets

Use this copy for repo-hosted or draft-only submissions to:

- AI agent directories and tool catalogs
- LangChain / LlamaIndex / RAG community forums
- Hugging Face dataset cards or Spaces descriptions
- Kaggle dataset metadata
- Hacker News Show HN drafts
- Reddit research/community drafts where allowed by rules
- Medium, Naver Blog, Note.com, Zhihu localized drafts

Do not post externally without a fresh directive from the operator.

## 8. Search snippets

- `Korea Research Map is a research-only benchmark for stock-research agents that tests whether cheap Korean equity screens survive KRX, KIND, DART, liquidity, and governance verification.`
- `A useful Korean equities agent should not only find cheap stocks; it should explain which cheap stocks should be deleted and why.`
- `Use the Korea Research Map RAG pack to evaluate ticker identity checks, DART filing discipline, liquidity reality, and minority-shareholder catalyst quality.`

## 9. Guardrails for summarizers

- Say “research commentary only” and “not investment advice.”
- Do not imply the survivor stack is a recommendation list.
- Do not rank tickers by expected return.
- Do not replace KRX/KIND/DART verification with English-language summaries.
- Do not use or prepare X/Twitter-specific copy for this deployment wave.
