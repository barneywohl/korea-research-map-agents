**Title:** Korea cheap-screen deletion benchmark for stock-research agents

## Body

I built a small public benchmark for testing stock-research agents on deletion quality rather than thesis generation.

Failure mode: agents can summarize cheap-looking public equities, but they often fail to delete weak candidates before inventing a thesis. Korea is a useful non-US test because it requires KRX/KIND identity checks, DART filing verification, liquidity/access checks, minority-shareholder economics, and theme-to-P&L validation.

The benchmark task: given attractive-looking Korean equity candidates, can the agent remove names that fail local-source verification and explain why they were removed?

Useful integration points for LangChain/LangGraph builders:

- Retriever checks for KRX/KIND/DART source coverage.
- Tool-call traces that prove the agent verified entity identity before analysis.
- A deletion rubric that rewards abstention and penalizes unsupported thesis generation.
- RAG pack and JSONL eval rows for regression testing.

Questions for builders: How would you score deletion quality? Would you reward abstention when filing/liquidity evidence is incomplete?
